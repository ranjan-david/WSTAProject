After losing his seat in 1929 , he regained it in 1931 , soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees , and against appeasement . The Conservatives were re-elected in 1959 with an increased majority on an electioneering budget . As a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition , haunted by memories of the Great Depression , he believed in the post-war settlement and the necessity of a mixed economy , championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand and pursuing corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth . It depicted Macmillan , the British Prime Minister at the time , in the guise of the comic-book hero Superman . After his resignation , Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an elder statesman . Near the end of his premiership , his government was rocked by the Vassall and Profumo scandals , which seemed to symbolise for the rebellious youth of the 1960s the moral decay of the British establishment . Belatedly recognising the dangers of strategic dependence , he sought a new role for Britain in Europe , but his unwillingness to disclose United States nuclear secrets to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom 's entry into the European Economic Community . When Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez Crisis , Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister . Reconfiguring the nation 's defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age , he ended National Service , strengthened the nuclear forces by acquiring Polaris , and pioneered the Nuclear Test Ban with the United States and the Soviet Union .

Macmillan was the last British prime minister born in the reign of Queen Victoria , the last to have served in the First World War , the last to wear a moustache when in office , and the last to receive an hereditary peerage . Nicknamed `` Supermac , '' he was known for his pragmatism , wit and unflappability . Rising to high office during the Second World War as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Macmillan then served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill 's successor Sir Anthony Eden .

Margaret Hilda Thatcher , Baroness Thatcher , -LRB- ; 13 October 1925 -- 8 April 2013 -RRB- was a British stateswoman , who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and as Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990 . After retiring from the Commons in 1992 , she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher -LRB- of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire -RRB- which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords . She narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 1984 . She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990 , after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership . Always a controversial figure , she has been lauded as one of the greatest and most influential politicians in British history , even as arguments over Thatcherism persist . Thatcher 's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983 . During this period her support for a Community Charge -LRB- referred to as the `` poll tax '' -RRB- was widely unpopular , and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet . Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation -LRB- particularly of the financial sector -RRB- , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state-owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government . On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . A long-delay time bomb was planted in the hotel by IRA member Patrick Magee , with the purpose of killing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet , who were staying at the hotel for the Conservative Party conference . A research chemist before becoming a barrister , Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959 . She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election . As Prime Minister , she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism . In 1975 , Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom . A Soviet journalist dubbed her The Iron Lady , a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style ."}

He was as trenchant a critic of his successors in his old age as he had been of his predecessors in his youth . He spent the rest of the war in a military hospital unable to walk , and suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life . After losing his seat in 1929 , he regained it in 1931 , soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees , and against appeasement . He was wounded three times , most severely in September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme . The Conservatives were re-elected in 1959 with an increased majority on an electioneering budget . As a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition , haunted by memories of the Great Depression , he believed in the post-war settlement and the necessity of a mixed economy , championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand and pursuing corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth . Macmillan served in the Grenadier Guards during the First World War . In his Bedford speech in July 1957 he told the nation they had ` never had it so good ' , but warned of the dangers of inflation , summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s . After his resignation , Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an elder statesman . Benefiting from favourable international conditions , he presided over an age of affluence , marked by low unemployment and high if uneven growth . Near the end of his premiership , his government was rocked by the Vassall and Profumo scandals , which seemed to symbolise for the rebellious youth of the 1960s the moral decay of the British establishment . Belatedly recognising the dangers of strategic dependence , he sought a new role for Britain in Europe , but his unwillingness to disclose United States nuclear secrets to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom 's entry into the European Economic Community . When Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez Crisis , Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister . Reconfiguring the nation 's defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age , he ended National Service , strengthened the nuclear forces by acquiring Polaris , and pioneered the Nuclear Test Ban with the United States and the Soviet Union . In international affairs , Macmillan rebuilt the special relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the Suez Crisis -LRB- of which he had been one of the architects -RRB- , and redrew the world map by decolonising sub-Saharan Africa . Macmillan was the last British prime minister born in the reign of Queen Victoria , the last to have served in the First World War , the last to wear a moustache when in office , and the last to receive an hereditary peerage . Nicknamed `` Supermac , '' he was known for his pragmatism , wit and unflappability . Rising to high office during the Second World War as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Macmillan then served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill 's successor Sir Anthony Eden . Maurice Harold Macmillan , 1st Earl of Stockton , -LRB- 10 February 1894 -- 29 December 1986 -RRB- was a British Conservative politician and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 10 January 1957 to 19 October 1963 ."}

The Hundred Years ' War was a series of conflicts waged from 1337 to 1453 by the House of Plantagenet , rulers of the Kingdom of England , against the House of Valois , rulers of the Kingdom of France , over the succession of the French throne . Local conflicts in neighbouring areas , which were contemporarily related to the war , including the War of the Breton Succession -LRB- 1341 -- 1364 -RRB- , the Castilian Civil War -LRB- 1366 -- 1369 -RRB- , the War of the Two Peters -LRB- 1356 -- 1375 -RRB- in Aragon , and the 1383 -- 85 Crisis in Portugal , were availed by the parties to advance their agendas . The war marked both the height of chivalry and its subsequent decline , and the development of strong national identities in both countries . The dissatisfaction of English nobles , resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings , became a factor leading to the civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses -LRB- 1455 -- 1487 -RRB- . The war owes its historical significance to multiple factors . Several overwhelming English victories in the war -- especially at Crecy , Poitiers , and Agincourt -- raised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph . Although primarily a dynastic conflict , the war gave impetus to ideas of French and English nationalism . Starting in 1429 , decisive French victories at Orl\u00e9ans , Patay , Formigny , and Castillon concluded the war in favour of France , with England permanently losing most of its major possessions on the continent . Historians commonly divide the war into three phases separated by truces : the Edwardian Era War -LRB- 1337 -- 1360 -RRB- ; the Caroline War -LRB- 1369 -- 1389 -RRB- ; and the Lancastrian War -LRB- 1415 -- 1453 -RRB- .

The song was written and composed by Paul Henning , and sung by Jerry Scoggins , who was accompanied by bluegrass musicians Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs . The band was founded by guitarist Lester Flatt and banjo player Earl Scruggs and is viewed by music historians as one of the premier bluegrass groups in the history of the genre . `` Foggy Mountain Breakdown '' is a bluegrass music instrumental written by Earl Scruggs and first recorded in 1949 by the bluegrass artists Flatt and Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys . Earl Eugene Scruggs -LRB- January 6 , 1924 -- March 28 , 2012 -RRB- was an American musician noted for popularizing a three-finger banjo picking style , now called `` Scruggs style '' , that is a defining characteristic of bluegrass music . Despite considerable success with Monroe , performing on the Grand Ole Opry and recording classic hits like `` Blue Moon of Kentucky '' , Scruggs gave notice in 1946 that he was quitting the band because of the exhausting touring schedule . Scruggs ' banjo instrumental called `` Foggy Mountain Breakdown '' , released in 1949 , became an enduring hit , and had a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde . Band member Lester Flatt resigned as well , and Flatt and Scruggs later paired up in a new group they called `` Flatt and Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys '' . Scruggs ' career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in a group called `` Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys '' . Over their 20-year association , Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 single records . `` Blue Moon of Kentucky '' is a waltz written in 1946 by bluegrass musician Bill Monroe and recorded by his band , the Blue Grass Boys . The duo broke up in 1969 , chiefly because Scruggs wanted to progress the music to a more modern sound and Flatt was a traditionalist who did not want to change the style because he thought it would alienate a fan base of bluegrass purists ."}

He was decorated with various international awards and significantly influenced various individuals and groups across the world . In the 2000s he forged alliances in the Latin American `` pink tide '' -- namely with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez 's Venezuela -- and signed Cuba up to the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas . After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia , he planned the overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista , launching a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953 . After Batista 's overthrow in 1959 , Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba 's Prime Minister . Under his administration , Cuba became a one-party socialist state ; industry and business were nationalized , and state socialist reforms were implemented throughout society . In 2006 he transferred his responsibilities to Vice-President Ra\u00fal Castro , who was elected to the presidency by the National Assembly in 2008 . Adopting a Marxist -- Leninist model of development , Castro converted Cuba into a one-party , socialist state under Communist Party rule , the first in the Western Hemisphere . After a year 's imprisonment , he traveled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group , the 26th of July Movement , with his brother Ra\u00fal Castro and Che Guevara . Abroad , Castro supported anti-imperialist revolutionary groups , backing the establishment of Marxist governments in Chile , Nicaragua , and Grenada , and sending troops to aid allies in the Yom Kippur War , Ogaden War , and Angolan Civil War . The United States came to oppose Castro 's government , and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination , economic blockade , and counter-revolution , including the Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961 . Policies introducing central economic planning and expanding healthcare and education were accompanied by state control of the press and the suppression of internal dissent . His supporters view him as a champion of socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary regime advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba 's independence from American imperialism . These actions , coupled with Castro 's leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1979 to 1983 and Cuba 's medical internationalism , increased Cuba 's profile on the world stage . Countering these threats , Castro formed an alliance with the Soviet Union and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba , sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis -- a defining incident of the Cold War -- in 1962 .

Critics view him as a dictator whose administration oversaw human-rights abuses , the exodus of a large number of Cubans , and the impoverishment of the country 's economy . Following the Soviet Union 's dissolution in 1991 , Castro led Cuba into its `` Special Period '' and embraced environmentalist and anti-globalization ideas . Born in Bir\u00e1n , Oriente as the son of a wealthy Spanish farmer , Castro adopted leftist anti-imperialist politics while studying law at the University of Havana . Returning to Cuba , Castro took a key role in the Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla war against Batista 's forces from the Sierra Maestra .

James VI and I -LRB- 19 June 1566 -- 27 March 1625 -RRB- was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24 March 1603 until his death . He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland . In 1603 , he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland , Elizabeth I , who died without issue . After the Union of the Crowns , he based himself in England -LRB- the largest of the three realms -RRB- from 1603 , only returning to Scotland once in 1617 , and styled himself `` King of Great Britain and Ireland '' . Four different regents governed during his minority , which ended officially in 1578 , though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583 . Sir Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed `` the wisest fool in Christendom '' , an epithet associated with his character ever since . He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years , a period known after him as the Jacobean era , until his death in 1625 at the age of 58 . James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months , after his mother Mary was compelled to abdicate in his favour . He sponsored the translation of the Bible that would later be named after him : the Authorised King James Version . He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England , including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament . James was the son of Mary , Queen of Scots , and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII , King of England and Lord of Ireland , positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones . James himself was a talented scholar , the author of works such as Daemonologie -LRB- 1597 -RRB- , The True Law of Free Monarchies -LRB- 1598 -RRB- , and Basilikon Doron -LRB- 1599 -RRB- .
